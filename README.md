# Battleship

Battleship is a web-based game that allows the user to play the classic board game battleship against an AI opponent. The user can place their ships on a 10x10 grid and try to sink the enemyâ€™s ships before they sink theirs.

### Motivation

The main goal of this project was to practice test-driven development (TDD) using Jest, a JavaScript testing framework. TDD is a software development process that involves writing tests before writing the actual code. This way, the code is more reliable, maintainable, and bug-free.
